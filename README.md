# Huffman-Text-Encoder
C++ implementation of Huffman Coding (lossless compression). Reads a .txt file, calculates character frequencies, builds a Huffman Tree using a priority queue, generates binary codes, encodes the text, and prints a frequency table plus size comparison and compression savings.
